# CVE-2026-0861: glibc integer overflow in memalign
# Justification:
#   - Debian security team classified as "no-dsa" (Minor issue, no security advisory)
#   - Low exploitability: requires attacker control over both size and alignment
#     arguments to memalign(), which is typically not attacker-controlled
#   - Fixed in upstream glibc 2.42-8, but not yet backported to Debian 12 or 13
#   - Affects nodejs20-debian13 distroless base image only
#   - Server container (distroless/static-debian12) has zero vulnerabilities
