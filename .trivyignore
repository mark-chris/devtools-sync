# CVE-2026-0861: glibc integer overflow in memalign
# Justification:
#   - Debian security team classified as "no-dsa" (Minor issue, no security advisory)
#   - Low exploitability: requires attacker control over both size and alignment
#     arguments to memalign(), which is typically not attacker-controlled
#   - Fixed in upstream glibc 2.42-8, but not yet backported to Debian 12 or 13
#   - Affects nodejs20-debian13 distroless base image only
#   - Server container (distroless/static-debian12) has zero vulnerabilities

CVE-2026-0861

# CVE-2025-15281: glibc wordexp uninitialized memory
# Justification:
#   - CVSS 7.5 (HIGH) - wordexp with WRDE_REUSE+WRDE_APPEND may return uninitialized memory
#   - DoS impact: process may abort if caller inspects we_wordv or calls wordfree
#   - Application does not use wordexp() function
#   - Fixed in upstream glibc 2.42+, not yet backported to Debian 12/13
#   - Affects nodejs20-debian13 distroless base image only

# CVE-2026-0915: glibc information disclosure via DNS
# Justification:
#   - Debian security team marked as "no-dsa" (Minor issue)
#   - MODERATE severity - information disclosure via zero-valued network queries
#   - Limited confidentiality loss, potential ASLR bypass helper
#   - Bug existed since 1996, fixed in glibc 2.42+
#   - Not yet backported to Debian 12/13
#   - Affects nodejs20-debian13 distroless base image only
